This project includes performance evaluation using metrics like PSNR(Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM(Structural Similarity Index) to measure image quality before and after denoising. This technique offers a balance between denoising efficiency and structural detail preservation, demonstrating its potential for integration into real-world medical imaging systems..
